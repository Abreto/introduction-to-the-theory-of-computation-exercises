Examine the following formal descriptions of sets so that you understand which
members they contain.
Write a short informal English description of each set.
\begin{enumerate}[label=\alph*.]
    \item $\{1, 3, 5, 8, \dots\}$
    \item $\{\dots, -1, -2, 0, 2, 4, \dots\}$
    \item $\{n | n = 2m \text{ for some } m \text{ in } \setN\}$
    \item $\{n |
        n = 2m \text{ for some } m \text{ in } \setN,
        \text{ and } n = 3k \text{ for some } k \text{ in } \setN
        \}$
    \item $\{w | w \text{ is a string of \texttt{0}s and \texttt{1}s and } w \text{ equals the reverse of } w\}$
    \item $\{n | n \text{ is an integer and } n = n + 1\}$
\end{enumerate}
